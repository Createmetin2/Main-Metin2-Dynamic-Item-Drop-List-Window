# Metin2 Dynamic Item DropList Window
What is going on?
Whenever I was playing on any server that had far too many drop items from monsters — I wondered — how am I going to find myself in this pile of scrap?

You click on one item and pick up a completely different one, thus littering your inventory.

With my solution, your players don't have to worry about it anymore.

# As a player
Pros:
* You don't have to worry about items gained by other players
* The alphabetical list will allow you to easily find the acquired item
* The dynamic list cleans and completes itself on a regular basis
* You do not have to worry that your list will be flooded with items that have been lying on the ground for a long time — only the items you have acquired will go to the list
* You can double-click on the name of the item and the character will automatically move towards it with the intention of picking up
* You can refresh the list by yourself
* You can select an item from the list and pick it up from the ground with one button

Min:
* You still need to be close to the item to pick it up — but it's probably fair.
